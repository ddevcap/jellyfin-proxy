A lightweight reverse proxy that sits in front of one or more Jellyfin servers
and presents them to clients as a single unified server.

## What it solves

Jellyfin has no built-in multi-server support. If you run several Jellyfin
instances (e.g. one per location, one per media type), every client must be
configured separately for each server and users must maintain separate accounts
on each.

`jellyfin-proxy` solves this by:

- Exposing a **single Jellyfin-compatible endpoint** that any standard Jellyfin
  client connects to without modification.
- Maintaining its **own user accounts** with hashed passwords — clients
  authenticate against the proxy, not against any backend directly.
- **Routing requests** transparently to the correct backend based on the item
  being requested, using a per-backend ID prefix to disambiguate items across
  servers.
- Letting you map each proxy user to accounts on one or more backends, with
  optional per-user tokens for fine-grained access control.
- **Merging libraries** across backends transparently — if two backends both
  expose a Movies library, clients see a single unified Movies library. Items
  are fetched from all contributing backends and concatenated. The per-backend
  ID prefix ensures items from different servers never collide.
- **Direct streaming** (optional) — when `DIRECT_STREAM=true` the proxy issues
  a `302` redirect for all streaming requests (video, audio, images, HLS)
  instead of piping bytes through itself. Clients connect directly to the
  backend over the local network (e.g. Tailscale), saving proxy bandwidth
  entirely. API calls still go through the proxy for ID rewriting.

## Architecture

```
Jellyfin client
      │
      ▼
 jellyfin-proxy  (Go + Gin, :8097 internally)
      │  served via Caddy (:8096 externally)
      │  ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
      ├─▶│  Backend A  (Movies)             │──┐
      ├─▶│  Backend B  (TV Shows)           │──┤
      └─▶│  Backend C  (Movies)             │──┘
         └──────────────────────────────────┘
                       ▼
            Merged into unified libraries:
            • Movies  (A + C combined)
            • TV Shows (B)
```

The proxy fans out requests to all backends in parallel, merges the responses,
and rewrites item IDs so every item is globally unique. Libraries with the same
type (e.g. Movies on Backend A + Movies on Backend B) are collapsed into a
single virtual library — clients see one "Movies" folder instead of two.

The Dockerfile bundles the Go binary, a [custom fork of the Jellyfin Web UI](https://github.com/ddevcap/jellyfin-proxy-web)
with proxy-specific patches, and Caddy into a single container managed by supervisord. Caddy serves
the web UI as static files and reverse-proxies all API traffic to the Go proxy.
The container runs as a non-root user (`jfproxy`).

**Background services:**

- **Health checker** — periodically pings every backend's
  `/System/Info/Public` endpoint. Backends that fail 2 consecutive checks are
  marked unavailable and skipped in fan-out requests until they recover.
- **Circuit breaker** — if a backend fails 5 consecutive live requests (e.g.
  connection refused), it is tripped offline immediately without waiting for
  the next health check cycle.
- **Session cleaner** — runs hourly to delete sessions that have been idle
  longer than `SESSION_TTL`.
- **Request ID** — every request gets a unique `X-Request-Id` header
  (generated or forwarded from upstream) for log correlation.

## Quick start

### Docker Compose (recommended)

1. Copy and edit the compose file:

```yaml
environment:
  DATABASE_URL: postgres://jellyfin:jellyfin@postgres:5432/jellyfin_proxy?sslmode=disable
  EXTERNAL_URL: https://jellyfin.example.com
  SERVER_ID: my-unique-server-id        # any stable string
  SERVER_NAME: "My Jellyfin Proxy"
  INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD: changeme      # only used when the DB is empty
```

2. Start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

On first startup the proxy automatically creates an admin user
(`admin` / the value of `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`). Once any user exists in the
database this seeding step is skipped on subsequent restarts.

Point your Jellyfin client at `http://<host>:8096` and log in with those
credentials.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://jellyfin:jellyfin@localhost:5432/jellyfin_proxy?sslmode=disable` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8096` | Address the Go proxy binds to |
| `EXTERNAL_URL` | `http://localhost:8096` | Publicly reachable URL reported to clients |
| `SERVER_ID` | `jellyfin-proxy-default-id` | Server UUID presented to clients |
| `SERVER_NAME` | `Jellyfin Proxy` | Server name presented to clients |
| `SESSION_TTL` | `720h` (30 days) | Session idle timeout (`0` = never expire) |
| `LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `10` | Failed logins per IP before temporary ban |
| `LOGIN_WINDOW` | `15m` | Sliding window for counting failed logins |
| `LOGIN_BAN_DURATION` | `15m` | How long an IP is banned after too many failures |
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_USER` | `admin` | Username for the auto-seeded admin account |
| `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | *(empty — seeding skipped)* | Password for the auto-seeded admin account |
| `DIRECT_STREAM` | `false` | Redirect stream requests directly to backends instead of proxying bytes. Requires clients to have direct network access to all backends (e.g. Tailscale) |

| `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `15s` | Max time to wait for in-flight requests during graceful shutdown |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | *(empty)* | Comma-separated additional origins allowed for credentialed CORS requests |
| `BITRATE_LIMIT` | `0` (unlimited) | Max remote client bitrate in bits/s, applied via Jellyfin user policy |
| `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL` | `30s` | How often the proxy pings backends to check availability. Backends that fail 2 consecutive checks are skipped in fan-out requests until they recover |

---

## Operational endpoints

These endpoints are **unauthenticated** and intended for container
orchestrators (Kubernetes, Docker health checks, load balancers).

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/health` | Liveness probe — always returns `200 {"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET` | `/ready` | Readiness probe — returns `200` if the database is reachable, `503` otherwise |

---

## Admin API

All admin endpoints are under `/proxy` and require a valid session token from
an **admin** user. Obtain a token by logging in:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8096/Users/AuthenticateByName \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Emby-Authorization: MediaBrowser Client="curl", Device="dev", DeviceId="dev", Version="1.0"' \
  -d '{"Username":"admin","Pw":"changeme"}' | jq .AccessToken
```

Pass the token as a header on every admin request:

```
X-Emby-Token: <token>
```

---

### Users

Proxy users are the accounts clients log in with. They are entirely managed by
the proxy and are independent of any backend Jellyfin accounts.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/proxy/users` | Create a user |
| `GET` | `/proxy/users` | List all users |
| `GET` | `/proxy/users/:id` | Get a user |
| `GET` | `/proxy/users/:id/backends` | List all backend mappings for a user |
| `PATCH` | `/proxy/users/:id` | Update display name, password, or admin flag |
| `DELETE` | `/proxy/users/:id` | Delete a user |

**Create user** — `POST /proxy/users`

```json
{
  "username": "alice",
  "display_name": "Alice",
  "password": "supersecret",
  "is_admin": false
}
```

---

### Backends

A backend is a real Jellyfin server that the proxy routes requests to. Each
backend needs a short unique **prefix** (1–8 chars) that is prepended to every
item ID originating from that server. This allows the proxy to route any item
request back to the correct backend without ambiguity.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/proxy/backends` | Register a backend |
| `GET` | `/proxy/backends` | List all backends |
| `GET` | `/proxy/backends/:id` | Get a backend |
| `PATCH` | `/proxy/backends/:id` | Update name, URL, or enabled state |
| `DELETE` | `/proxy/backends/:id` | Remove a backend |
| `GET` | `/proxy/backends/health` | Health status of all backends (available, last error, failure count) |

**Register a backend** — `POST /proxy/backends`

```json
{
  "name": "Movies",
  "url": "http://jellyfin-movies:8096",
  "prefix": "mov"
}
```

The proxy fetches the server ID from the backend's public `/System/Info`
endpoint (no credentials required) and persists the backend record. Per-user
tokens are created separately via `POST /proxy/backends/:id/login`.

- `prefix` — must be unique across all backends and must not change after
  clients have cached item IDs.


---

### Backend user mappings

Each proxy user that should have access to a backend must be mapped to an
account on that backend. There are two ways to create a mapping:

#### Option A — Login (recommended)

The proxy authenticates against the backend on the user's behalf and stores the
resulting backend user ID and token automatically.

```
POST /proxy/backends/:id/login
```

```json
{
  "proxy_user_id": "<proxy-user-uuid>",
  "username": "alice-on-backend",
  "password": "backendpassword"
}
```

#### Option B — Manual mapping

If you already know the backend user ID and token:

```
POST /proxy/backends/:id/users
```

```json
{
  "user_id": "<proxy-user-uuid>",
  "backend_user_id": "<jellyfin-user-uuid-on-backend>",
  "backend_token": "<optional-per-user-token>"
}
```

When `backend_token` is omitted, authenticated requests to the backend will be
sent without credentials. Use `POST /proxy/backends/:id/login` (Option A) to
automatically obtain and store a token.

**Other mapping operations:**

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/proxy/backends/:id/users` | List all user mappings for a backend |
| `PATCH` | `/proxy/backends/:id/users/:mappingId` | Update mapping (token, enabled) |
| `DELETE` | `/proxy/backends/:id/users/:mappingId` | Remove a mapping |

Set `"enabled": false` on a mapping to block a specific user from a specific
backend without deleting the mapping.

## Known limitations / Roadmap

The proxy is functional for day-to-day media playback but some areas are still
rough or not yet implemented:

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **User images / avatars** | ✅ Implemented | Profile pictures are stored in the proxy database. Upload, fetch, and delete are supported via the standard Jellyfin image endpoints |
| **Live TV** | ⚠️ Partial | Channels and Programs are merged across backends; Info is proxied from the first backend. Covered by tests — recording management and guide data are not proxied |
| **SyncPlay** | ⚠️ Not supported | Returns an empty list — cross-backend sync is not possible |
| **Search** | ✅ Implemented | Results from all backends are merged into a single response |
| **Download / file export** | ✅ Implemented | `GET /Items/:itemId/Download` — streams or redirects (DirectStream) the file from the correct backend |
| **Lyrics** | ✅ Implemented | `GET /Audio/:itemId/Lyrics` — proxied JSON response from the correct backend |
| **Collections** | ✅ Implemented | `GET /Collections/:itemId/Items` — paged item list proxied from the correct backend |
| **Admin write operations** | ❌ Not implemented | Jellyfin admin actions (library scans, user management on the backend, etc.) must be performed directly on each backend |
| **Subtitle upload** | ❌ Not implemented | Writing subtitles back to a backend is not proxied |
| **Transcoding sessions** | ⚠️ Partial | Progress reporting is forwarded but session lists are not aggregated across backends |
| **Notifications / webhooks** | ❌ Not implemented | Backend-originated push events are not forwarded to clients |
| **Multi-backend watch state sync** | ⚠️ Partial | Played / favorite actions are propagated to matching items on other backends via TMDB/IMDB provider ID matching. Items without provider IDs are not synced |

---

## Typical setup flow

1. Start the stack with `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` set.
2. Log in as `admin` and save the session token.
3. Register each Jellyfin backend with `POST /proxy/backends`.
4. Create proxy users with `POST /proxy/users`.
5. For each user + backend combination call `POST /proxy/backends/:id/login` to
   create the mapping.
6. Point Jellyfin clients at the proxy URL and log in with proxy credentials.

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Go | ≥ 1.24 | [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) |
| golangci-lint | ≥ 2.0 | `brew install golangci-lint` or [golangci-lint.run](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/) |
| lefthook | ≥ 2.0 | `brew install lefthook` or [github.com/evilmartians/lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) |
| Docker + Compose | any recent | [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) |

### Local setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddevcap/jellyfin-proxy.git
cd jellyfin-proxy

# Install the pre-commit hook (lint + test runs automatically on every commit).
lefthook install

# Run the test suite.
go test ./...

# Run the linter.
golangci-lint run ./...
```

### Pre-commit hook

`lefthook.yml` registers a `pre-commit` hook that runs automatically whenever
Go files are staged:

1. **`golangci-lint run --fix`** — lints the whole module and auto-stages any
   files it fixes.
2. **`go test ./...`** — runs the full test suite.

The hook is skipped entirely when no `.go` files are staged (e.g. docs-only
commits), keeping it fast. To bypass it in an emergency:

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

### Code style

- All code is formatted with `gofmt` / `goimports` — the linter enforces this.
- New endpoints should follow the patterns in `api/handler/media.go` and have
  corresponding tests in the same package.
- Keep handler functions thin: routing, ID translation, and delegating to
  `sc.ProxyJSON` / `sc.ProxyStream`. Business logic belongs in the `backend`
  or `idtrans` packages.
- The linter configuration lives in `.golangci.yml` — update it if you enable
  or disable linters as part of your change.
